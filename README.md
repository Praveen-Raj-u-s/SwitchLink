# SwitchLink

 SwitchLink is a Smart Switch Control Unit that goes beyond conventional remote switch control. It features a Smart USB charging system utilizing an OP Amp comparator to detect the full-charge status of connected devices. This feature is especially useful for devices and appliances lacking built-in Charge Protection Circuitry. When a device reaches full charge, SwitchLink notifies the user with defined acoustic notifications generated by a Piezo-buzzer via PWM.
